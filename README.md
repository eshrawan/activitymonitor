# brainwave

My brother is differently abled and is very picky about his likes and dislikes. The people in his life, his teachers, therapists and us as a family, spend a lot of time figuring out what's right for him; his likes and dislikes. I sought to explore how I could potentially monitor whether or not he likes something, especially because he is not very vocal in his thoughts. I used the NeuroSky brainwave kit and used sensors with the RaspberryPi to create a system that could monitor several different activities for him to help out my parents in figuring out whether he likes a certain subject he is studying.

After preliminary research adn testing, I decided to work on a complete system that could work for several other children as well who were differently abled. This project is to study and monitor the likes and dislikes of differently abled kids by measuing their level of calmness through a NeuroSky brainwave reader. 

To monitor the different activities taking place, a real time display will be created which can then be displayed on any monitor. It shows the day of the activity, and also a reference to the activity being tested. A concentration of the Level of Calmness (LOC) will be recorded and isplayed on the screen. A historic data graph will also be simultaneously uploaded to the cloud for each child to keep track of their reactions to the different activities.

The digital values of the LOC will be prescribed in **three ranges** using the built-in system of the NeuroSky:

                                Low: ≤ 30 
                                Medium: 31-60
                                High: ≥ 60

The data on the cloud will be helpful to find any discrepancies with past data for a particular activity, and it can also be used to form a fitting schedule for the child which would benefit them.The activities chosen to test my results are listed below, but any therapist/parent/those whom concerned could set up their own prescribed activities list that is personlized, and easily store their results with this could system. 

# List of activities (will be age appropiated further during testing): 
					  
					  
				1. Listening to music 
                                2. Watching educational videos
                                3. Reading/ listening to a story book
                                4. Solving puzzles/brain teasers/mental math
                                5. Eating various food
                                6. Playing video games

These activities ensure that those who are concerned can learn what kind of a learner a specific child is (visual, kinesthetic, auditory) and can track his progress on various life-learning skills as well. It can track his attention and calmness throughout studying, and hence times for scheduling can also be made way easier.

This project is currently Incomplete and is in its research and testing phase.
